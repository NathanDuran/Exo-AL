            <p>On the classify page you will be shown stars light curves, which are graphs of a stars<br>
                brightness over time. The goal is to look for the tell-tale 'dips' in luminosity that occur<br>
                when a planet passes in front of its host star, also known as a transit. It is important to<br>
                make the distinction between 'gaps' and 'dips'. Any gaps you see in the light curve will be<br>
                caused by other factors not related to an exoplanet. We are looking for areas where the<br>
                luminosity has dipped lower but has still been recorded. There are some light curves,<br>
                with their transits highlighted, in the <a href="#examples"> examples section.</a><br>
                <br>
                PLEASE NOTE: The light curve display works best in Chrome or Safari Browsers.<br>

                At the top of the page the current star ID is displayed along with the quarter number<br>

                Using the slider at the bottom of the light curve you can give each star a score<br>
                depending on how confident you are that it has one or more transit-like features.<br>
                <br>
                1 to 100 (green), where 1 is not confident at all and 100 is positive, indicates that you<br>
                think it has transit-like features and therefore may have an orbiting exoplanet.<br>
                <br>
                -1 to -100 (red) indicates that you think it does not have transit like features and<br>
                therefore may not have an orbiting exoplanet.<br>
                <br>
                0 indicates that you are not sure either way.<br>

                The submit button records your chosen score for the star and loads the next star for you<br>
                to view.<br>

                <label class="instructionLabel">4)</label>
                The next and back buttons on either side of the light curve let you cycle through different<br>
                light curves for the current star. These were generated over different yearly quarters of<br>
                the Kepler mission.<br>
                <br>
                <label class="instructionLabel">5)</label>
                The light curve itself can be zoomed and panned using the left mouse button and scroll<br>
                wheel, though performance may vary on browsers other than Chrome and Safari.<br>
                <br>
                It is perfectly ok to be unsure about a particular light curve. For many of the light curves<br>
                you view it will be very difficult to distinguish any transit-like features if there are any.<br>
                Generally it is more helpful to provide some score rather than 0, even if it is very small.<br>
                <br>
                Using the next and back buttons on either side of the light curve is often helpful if you are<br>
                unsure. Light curves generated over different periods of time can reveal features or<br>
                simply be clearer than others. It is also important to note that a light curve for one<br>
                quarter may not contain a transit while another does, simply because planets take time<br>
                to orbit their star. If we were viewing our sun for example, we would have to view at<br>
                least four quarters worth of light curves to spot earths transit signal.<br>
